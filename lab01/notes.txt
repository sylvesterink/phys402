Part 2:
*******
Delay constant: 100000 cycles per "ms"
Delay value: 1000 "ms" per led change
Time for one loop, 0-15: 2 seconds (the slowest we could get)

Unfortunately, we can't achieve a proper timing delay, as the compiler
seems to optimize our loop.  (This is one reason a loop like this is
not a dependable method for delay.)

Part 3:
*******
On oscilloscope
With 5ms delay: 4.52ms
With 50us delay: 56us
(On pin 3 on JC)
No func: 496ns, or .5us
With func: 1.62us

We determined that with a function call, the flip took about 3 times as 
long to perform, with a majority of the time being during the off state
(which was when the function was called and returned).
We also found that by having the flip commands copy-pasted repeatedly in
the loop, the loop ran slightly faster, as there were less times the loop
instructions had to be called to jump back to the start of the loop,
(about 12 instructions for 3 loops of 1 flip vs 8 instructions for one
loop of 3 flips)
